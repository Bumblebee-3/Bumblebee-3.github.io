# Introduction to Java & BlueJ

### Java

Java is an **`Object Oriented Programming`** (OOP) Language, similar to `PHP`, `C++`, `C#`, `Kotlin`, `Python` and `JavaScript`.

It is widely used in the `Android` Operating System.

It is **`Platform Independant`**, **meaning programs written in Java can be executed on any other platform** such as `Windows`, `Unix`, `Linux`, `Mac OS`, etc.

Java is considered as a **`Strongly typed` language**, because **it demands the declaration of every variable with a data type**.

### BlueJ

BlueJ is an **`Integrated Development Environment (IDE)`** for Java. In other words, BlueJ is a editor for Java programs, and can also execute the programs. It provides a `User Interface` for Java.
